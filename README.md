# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Capstone-Project
GOAL: Create a model to predict whether or not a customer will Churn .

For this project, We will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup firm that provides the customers internet facilities like: Internet connectivity. Our job is to extract customer historical data reportings from Servers sources using Python libraries and, webscraping online and understand why customer churn. After collecting this data We will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns and predict, why customers churn, we use the Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boost Classifier and Adaboost classifier for this Project.
